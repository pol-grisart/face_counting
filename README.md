# face_counting
/train_set : Training set intially empty. 
Model operational.

Prerequisites (Anaconda) :
!pip install cv
!pip install cv2
!pip keras

Run:
The test_video_Baguette.ipynb allows you to detect the number of faces on your webcam in real time using a pre-trained model (convolutional neural network)
You might have difficulties to run the code if your laptopt configuration use the Keras' backend is using Tensorflow. For this project, you need too use Theano's backend.
